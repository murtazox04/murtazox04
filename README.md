# 👨‍💻 Murtazo Xurramov

Hi there! I'm **Murtazo**, a backend engineer and founder of **[Velto](https://velto.uz)** — a carbon analytics and ESG compliance startup from Uzbekistan.  
I build **high-performance backend systems** and **developer infrastructure** with a focus on scalability, efficiency, and clean architecture.

I specialize in **Python (Django, DRF, FastAPI)** and actively explore **Rust** for ultra-low-latency microservices. My work combines solid engineering principles with startup execution speed.
